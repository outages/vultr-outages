Customers with only newer block storage products may ignore this alert.\r\n\r\nThe legacy block storage product is experiencing substantially degraded performance due to a hardware related issue which is under active troubleshooting.  Some specific volumes may be very slow or producing I/O errors at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe're working to resolve this as soon as possible.  While in-flight I/O operations are affected, no impact is expected on previously stored data.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this is a good opportunity for a reminder that the older block storage cluster is a legacy product which we have been encouraging and executing migrations on, to reduce or eliminate the possibility of these issues.  All relevant customers have been contacted at least twice about the migration process (some three times or more) .\r\n\r\nThank you for understanding."
