As part of this, we are continuing to retrofit new, more performant hardware in VOBS EWR.

The outage occurred as a result of surging demand before our planned incremental hardware retrofit (to match our NVMe based clusters in other locations) could be completed and the cluster was not able to consistently perform routine balancing operations.  \r\n\r\nOur team’s restoration priorities are preventing data loss, followed by data availability, restoring write access, and finally performance. While user access is limited, the cluster is actively rebalancing and is expected to reach an acceptable read state soon. In the meantime, you should find that objects can be read with intermittent success, retries may produce the best results.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOBS in other locations (SJC1, AMS1, BLR1 & DEL1) already have high performance NVMe storage in place and we recommend creating a new VOBS subscription there for your workloads while the extended maintenance efforts in EWR are completed. While we expect your access to VOBS EWR to be restored soon, the platform will be under higher load than normal during the hardware replacement process over the next few weeks. \r\n\r\nWe will provide regular updates until normal read/write access is restored."
