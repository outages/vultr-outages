During this maintenance window, creating, attaching, resizing, and deletion of Block Storage volumes may be temporarily unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe Vultr Storage team also plans to migrate existing block storage volumes to a new cluster. The process will require detaching your block storage volume and then reattaching the volume in the new cluster. \r\n\r\nIn order to guarantee no loss of data, please detach your block storage manually before the maintenance window begins to ensure there is no data actively being written to it when we detach it from the current cluster. \r\n\r\nOnce the maintenance window ends please check your block storage manually to ensure it is working properly. If you encounter any issues with re-attaching your storage volume first please attempt to re-mount the volume or reboot your VPS. If this doesn't work please open a support ticket. \r\n\r\nThank you"

The outage occurred as a result of surging demand before our planned incremental hardware retrofit (to match our NVMe based clusters in other locations) could be completed and the cluster was not able to consistently perform routine balancing operations.  \r\n\r\nOur team’s restoration priorities are preventing data loss, followed by data availability, restoring write access, and finally performance. While user access is limited, the cluster is actively rebalancing and is expected to reach an acceptable read state soon. In the meantime, you should find that objects can be read with intermittent success, retries may produce the best results.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOBS in other locations (SJC1, AMS1, BLR1 & DEL1) already have high performance NVMe storage in place and we recommend creating a new VOBS subscription there for your workloads while the extended maintenance efforts in EWR are completed. While we expect your access to VOBS EWR to be restored soon, the platform will be under higher load than normal during the hardware replacement process over the next few weeks. \r\n\r\nWe will provide regular updates until normal read/write access is restored."
