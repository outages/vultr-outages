During this maintenance window, creating, attaching, resizing, and deletion of Block Storage volumes may be temporarily unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe Vultr Storage team also plans to migrate existing block storage volumes to a new cluster. The process will require detaching your block storage volume and then reattaching the volume in the new cluster. \r\n\r\nIn order to guarantee no loss of data, please detach your block storage manually before the maintenance window begins to ensure there is no data actively being written to it when we detach it from the current cluster. \r\n\r\nOnce the maintenance window ends please check your block storage manually to ensure it is working properly. If you encounter any issues with re-attaching your storage volume first please attempt to re-mount the volume or reboot your VPS. If this doesn't work please open a support ticket. \r\n\r\nThank you"
