Our engineers make every effort to minimize system impact, however, network reachability to New Jersey instances may be affected for some, or all, of the scheduled maintenance window as we perform this work. While itâ€™s important to be aware of start and end times of the maintenance window, due to our redundant network architecture, our engineers expect that you may see little to no impact at all while the work is performed."
