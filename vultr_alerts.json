We will continue to closely monitor services as the situation evolves, and we will advise our customers of any changes which have the potential to impact service delivery.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is a crucial time to remind our customers about the importance of the 3-2-1 Backup Strategy for safeguarding all critical data. Please see the case study here for more information: https://www.vultr.com/docs/case-study-use-a-321-backup-strategy-at-vultr/\r\n\r\nPlease note that Vultr Snapshots and Backups are stored in the same location as the instance they are made from, however when you deploy a new instance from them in a different location, they will be automatically transferred and stored in the new location as well."
